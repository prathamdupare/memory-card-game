# Valorant Memory Card Game

## Overview

The Valorant Memory Card Game is a web-based memory card game built with React. Test your memory by matching Valorant agents' cards in this fun and challenging game.

The game follows these simple rules:

- You start with a grid of face-down cards, each representing a Valorant agent.
- Click on a card to reveal the agent's image.
- Click on another card to reveal a second agent's image.
- If the two agents match, they remain face up.
- If they don't match, they flip back face down.
- Keep flipping cards and matching agents until all agents are revealed.
